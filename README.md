# Doushiryokucheck_backend

This is the backend for the https://github.com/dan-turner-djt/Doushiryokucheck website.

It is an Express.js Node.js server written in TypeScript and hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, which sends and receives data to and from the frontend through the API. It uses my TypeScript library, jv-conjugator (https://github.com/dan-turner-djt/jv-conjugator), to check answers are correct.
