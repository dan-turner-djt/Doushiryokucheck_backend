# Doushiryokucheck_backend

This is the backend for the https://github.com/dan-turner-djt/Doushiryokucheck website.

It is an Express.js Node.js server hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, which sends and receives data to and from the frontend through the API.

It currently reads data from files but will be integrated with a database in the future.
